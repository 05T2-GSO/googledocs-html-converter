<h3><u><strong>Audition Requirement & Excerpts </strong></u></h3>
<p><em>Please see the audition material packet corresponding to your instrument group and the ensemble for which you wish to audition. </em></p>
<h4><u><strong>Audition FAQ</strong></u></h4>
<p><strong>1. Which ensemble should I audition for?</strong></p>
<p>Check the ensemble descriptions and excerpts to see which ensemble best matches your current performing level according to the listed audition requirements. While successfully passing an audition for a particular orchestra makes you eligible for a spot, it <u>does not guarantee</u> placement in that same ensemble as some groups/sections have a maximum number of players. If you’re still unsure about which ensemble to audition for, re-read the ensemble descriptions and ask a teacher for guidance. If you have previously participated in GYSO, we recommend auditioning for either the ensemble you were in last year or the next ensemble up.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do I need to have my audition music memorized?</strong></p>
<p>Memorization is not necessary. We want you to feel as comfortable as possible in your audition.</p>
<p><strong>3. Why is school music participation required for GYSO students, provided that a music program exists at your school?</strong></p>
<p>GYSO is a strong supporter of local music programs. We believe that school programs are a true foundation of our musical community. Our ensembles are meant to be an extension of technical and artistic growth. They are not a substitute for participating in your school music program. Exceptions can be made if permitted by your school’s director, and in the past have been for reasons including scheduling conflicts with AP courses. This is their decision and we have no way of influencing it. If a student is homeschooled, or a program is not offered, students may participate if we’re advised of the situation.</p>
<p><strong>4. When does GYSO rehearse and when does the program start and stop?  </strong></p>
<p>GYSO ensembles rehearse once a week (). The GYSO season follows the KSU/ Cobb County Schools academic calendar. Our season typically begins in August and ends in May.</p>
<p><strong>5. Do I need to dress up for the audition?</strong></p>
<p>Dressing up is not mandatory. Most people wear dressy-casual, comfortable clothes in the audition.</p>
<p><strong>6. When and how will I find out the results of the audition?</strong></p>
<p>You will not receive any audition results over the phone or on the website. Results will be emailed to the email(s) provided on the Digital Audition Submission Form approximately 2 weeks following the registration deadline.</p>
<p><strong>7. Do current GYSO members have to audition each season?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, <u>all students</u> must audition each season. Returning GYSO students are not guaranteed a spot in their previous ensemble.</p>
